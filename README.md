# CPP-01

This repository contains a series of C++ exercises designed to reinforce fundamental concepts such as classes, memory management, and object-oriented programming. Each subdirectory (`ex00` to `ex06`) contains a separate exercise with its own source files and `Makefile`.

## Structure

- **ex00**: Introduction to classes and dynamic memory allocation. Implements a simple `Zombie` class and demonstrates object creation and destruction.
- **ex01**: Expands on the `Zombie` concept with a `zombieHorde` function to manage multiple objects.
- **ex02**: Further exercises on memory management and object arrays.
- **ex03**: Demonstrates composition and interaction between classes (`HumanA`, `HumanB`, and `Weapon`).
- **ex04**: Additional exercises focusing on class design and encapsulation.
- **ex05**: Implements the `Harl` class to practice method overloading and message filtering.
- **ex06**: Extends the `Harl` class with more advanced features.

## How to Build and Run

Each exercise folder contains a `Makefile` for building the corresponding program. To compile and run an exercise:

```bash
cd ex00  # or ex01, ex02, etc.
make
./<executable_name>  # Usually 'main' or as specified in the folder
```

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`)
- Linux environment (recommended)
